# Music Library API - A Web API using Express, mySQL and Sequelize

This project is a Music Library API to store information about artists, albums and songs. Here we implemented a CRUD REST API to interact with a MySQL database.

For this project, we fired up an instance of MySQL locally to use with our Express API.

Once our MySQL instance was set-up, we implemented a REST API to allow us to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) actions on artists, albums and songs.

This is a project completed as part of the Software Engineering FastTrack course at Manchester Codes.
